### Programming Assignment 4: Getting And Cleaning Data  
The assignment concerns a series of operations to be executed with different data files in order to create one single and tidy dataset.
Following files are included:

**run_analysis**  
This is the R-script that must be run to generate the tidy dataset.   
The script itself contains comment for each step that has been taken and will explain how to obtain a resultset from gathering the raw data till assembling the final tidy dataset.  

IMPORTANT!

Only when the original data files (not included) are located in your R-Studion working directory (subfolder **"UCI HAR Dataset"**) the resultset can be reproduced!  

**result.txt**  
This is the final dataset. This is a space separated file which can be loaded in R studio using following statement:  


**Codebook.rmd**  
Dictionairy describing all data elements within the final dataset _(result.txt)_
